# Liam Hughes

Welcome to the source code for my CV. I chose to write my CV using a web page in order to give me more control over it's look and feel. I really wanted to try and create a more interesting CV than your run of the mill MS Word template. 

I then decided that if I was going to do this I might as well do it to work on some new skills. I have worked with **many** javascript UI frameowrks over the years but I hadn't done too much with React. I was interested in learning and understanding this framework more. I had worked with React when building my wifes business web page [https://tygwynreflex.co.uk/](https://tygwynreflex.co.uk/) but having more practce with React seemed like a good idea.

Have built a print version of my CV locally, it seemed like a good oportunity to make my CV stand out more with a web page. Being as it was already a web page in the print version it was simple to just publish this online using GitHub. I made some amendments to the print page to make it more responsive and to add some extra details, like the link that hopefully brought you here :blush:.

Now having comepleted these tasks I thought, it seemed a shame to not just show how the page had been built. So I've published a fork of the source code (somewhat anonymised) here. So feel free to browse around.

This page isn't exactly the most complicated interface I've built. It has limited interaction but here are some of the skills I've tried to show you here:

- Basic React and Javascript skills
- Understanding of web page security fundermentals (check out the [CSP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP))
- Responsive design, the working page should be accessible from you mobile to your printer to your desktop
- Some simple CSS transitions

Hopefully you like what you see here. If you want to contact me regarding any of this (and you don't already have my details) then you should check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liam-hughes-69b9432a/).
